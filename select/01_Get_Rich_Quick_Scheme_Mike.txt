Look what you get, hehehe
People don't get it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Yuh, yeah

Said I'm more than just this image you were tryna sell
Try to water down the mission for the clientele
I been holdin' back from shittin', they don't like the smell
But they ain't see me for a minute so I might as well
As a child, could tell
It's hard to get back in position, we gon' find the frail
You gotta get it where you fit in, this a tryin' scale
For this kinda work, if you ain't tryna fail
Can never change to see your mission for the finer bail
Takin' trains west to Pacific, I should try the mail
I think he only pressed to live 'cause he might die in Hell
I guess it kinda hurt
When God tell you if you feel it, it's behind the braille
Time you left for the experience, forgot the wealth
The only thing that I inherited was blockin' help
It's part of pops' concern
Remember cringin' at the mirror, I was not myself (Ooh)
That's still a lot to learn
I came back from lightin' bridges I forgot to burn
The first stride again bigger, had a loss of thirst
And never idolized a nigga with a office shirt
You think I did it for the figures? It was all for her
