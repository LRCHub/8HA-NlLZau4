Schemers always scheming
And they're scheming all the time
By the flicker of the campfire the scheming dimly shine
And they laugh and fantasize about the prize
If the color's fresh and creamy they will snatch it from the rise
Aw, schemers wretched scheming
Scheme on into the night
Always formulating plans while tucked well out of sight
And they laugh and carry on without the fear
Of knowing the ramifications of the walls with tiny ears
(Evil laugh)
Scheming always scheming
And they're scheming all the time
Weasly little schemers they got scamming on their minds
Enamoring the masses less than wise
The most successful schemers tell the most collosal lies
