1979, it died a fucking serious death
What did? Punk rock!
Harp Bar, best bar in the world
It used to be but no more
What happened?
What's that?
What happened?
What do you mean what happened?

I don't want this world
Where our troubles and complaints are justified
It's just numbers and stats til it's your life
I don't want to fight
The wicked rumble under your rights
Nothing changes at night
It's just thunder til it's your life
And I don't want the sight
Of that saints that hate
Unjust with pride
It's slumber with rats
Til it's your life

So goodnight
Fuck off
Goodnight

How can we not feel this rage?
When the therapy costs more than half your wage
And you're turfеd back out the same, that very day
Ya covеr your teenage pain
By pushing further into the grey
The local politics of the housing estates
'Cause getting out seems like no stage
And tomorrows aren't todays
And I've felt this way
Since Turn The Page
There's no walk away
Yet there's still sense in what I say

Same shite at 26
You shell down cans and drinks
For the sake of making it through the week surrounded by pricks
Your posh drugs aren't interesting
You hate workers
You hate those that can't
Your drugs aren't class, they're upper middle class
You, teeth whitening, pay for designer dogs
Da crashed the banks but kept his job
Few bob for a week in Mykonos
And ya joke about the Junkies
Addicts that get dehumanised 'cause they're poor
But those problems start at your door
Your eyes are closed
Fuck off

We were just kids
And now we're something else
Thoughts of the self on the shelf
'Cause it seems sometimes
All the love in these songs, is not enough
'Cause the world is fucked
We were just kids
And now we're something else
Thoughts of the self on the shelf
'Cause it seems sometimes
All the love in these songs, is not enough
'Cause the world is fucked
Top scheme

Love is kind to the least of men
