Fall away
I hold your name
Never fall away

This is gun, come undone
Does it burn, like a [?]
Lose it for love, lose it for love
Does it wait like a wave

Never fall away
Never fall, never fade

Is it lost, is it game
Is it released from a pain
Wizard for, [?]
Better shut your boy
Praise
If you could come back in time
Could we learn to be scared
What is it for, [?]
Do it, draw

Never fall away
I hold your name
Never back

Never fall down
Never fall
Never fight
Never fall

Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn
Go, Go, Go, Go
Wait
