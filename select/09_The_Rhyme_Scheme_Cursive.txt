Words have no feeling
Without loaded meanings
Words take too long to come across
Meanings are meant for
Defining definitions
We load them for effect
It's cheap but it's working
It's the best I've got to get your attention
I could never get your attention
I could never please you
These verses are wasted
On words you won't relate to
On words you'll never hear

It's not working- i don't feel any better
I don't feel so well
The verbal breakdown has failed
So I'm whispering secrets
Hush, hush on the loudspeaker
Words sculpted on verse
Become absurd
But it's the best i've got to get your attention
I could never get your attention
I could never please you
Words so sympathetic
Symphonic, yet- pathetic
Are tossed on to the song

The meaning is lost
Words just wont work
Words are slowly demeaning
Their meanings
Words make things worse
Words are always repeating
Losing their feeling
These words failed
Words fail
