# Flaw – Scheme

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
It up woke in me years ago,
How this was meant to be.
All of those falsehoods plain
to see.
They dug,
And hung their greed.
Will there be profit you could
see?
If only we were blind.
Lonley and sheltered,
Your life is free,
But it's still one step behind.
CHORUS
Just like me
They tried their rules on me
They tried their rules on me
They tried their rules on me,
me, me...
I broke those chains and
fucking split.
And so you,
And so you,
And so you,
Pass all the fascist asses
Ignore those classes
Of bottleneck masses
Producing an all but awful
stench,
Delivering a section of all the
money stole and spent.
As you start to reconize you're
in the game
You start to recognize
And then from day to day
You see the playing board is
you.
Growing afflictions head to toe,
This never should have been.
But placing blame is cowardly.
Restructure must begin.
Will there be profits you could
see?
If only we were blind.
Lonely and sheltered,
Your life is free,
But it's still one step behind.
CHORUS
The playing board is you.
The playing board is you..
The playing board is you...
